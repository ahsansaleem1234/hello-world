# hello-world
1st repository on Github (fingers crossed for the future)

Hi Guys and Gals,

I am Ahsan aka Mana. This is my first github repository. I shall start various projects related to Data Science in R and Python in the near future. Moreover, I am about to immerse myself in to the field of Machine Learning.

I have completed various preliminary courses on DataCamp.com and have been planning to dig deep in R and Python.

I have heard a lot about the importance and usefulness of Github. Glad to be here.
